# From Jim, April 30, 2025

-   [ ] The title is misleading. This is not the Apps Focal Landscape so I would give it a different name based on the boundary provided
-   [ ] Left letter is truncated and the formatting looks off for BPS chart
-   [ ] Ditto for the EVT graphic
-   [ ] What do the gray boxes in the Historical Disturbances chart represent?
-   [ ] I am not sure you need the chart and the horizontal bar graph. Arenâ€™t they the same information? I will keep the bar graph if one is deleted.
-   [ ] Current Riparian is truncated in the Change chart
-   [ ] replace latin
